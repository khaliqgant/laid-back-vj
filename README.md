Laid Back VJ
============
> Sit back and watch all of your favorite songs music videos

# Idea
* I listen to a lot more music than I watch music videos, but sometimes I want
to watch music videos but it's hard to find my favorite songs music videos
* Using a few different sources (lastfm, spotify) do a look up on Youtube
and queue up a bunch of videos to watch

# Roadmap
* Integrate LastFm initially
* Spotify after

# Future Ideas
* Make categories of music videos to choose from based on your library
* Based on popularity, rare videos -- based on scrobbles or youtube watches?
* Genres
* Last month scrobble videos
* Last year scrobbles

# APIS
* [Lastfm](https://www.last.fm/api)
